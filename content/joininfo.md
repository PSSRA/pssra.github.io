## About us

The Puget Sound chapter of the SRA is an organization focused on firearms education among comrades. We have some excellent instructors who run highly-inclusive classes for our members at many different levels of firearms familiarity, in several locations all over Washington. We also have more free-form range days, as well as occasional social events and an active Discord for vetted members. Finally, we also have members who regularly attend competitions to test their training against difficult shooting challenges, and help other interested members get into competitive shooting.

What we DON'T do as an org is organize any kind of direct action, protesting as a group, or ever show up to events armed. We also don't generally do mutual aid or community outreach that isn't firearms education related. We don't have prohibitions on our members doing those things (joining the Discord after vetting is a great way to meet comrades in your area, and we try to help connect members with other orgs who do focus on mutual aid), but the organization does not take part. (We say this up front because some people come to us looking for that kind of activity.)

## Vetting/intake backlog
While we are working through an intake backlog due to current events -- an unprecedented number of emails since November -- we are temporarily instituting a queue for bringing new folks into the intake/vetting process so that you're not waiting around for vetting forever. More info:

**PSSRA's intake and vetting** 

has traditionally been "as fast as we can get people in"-- as soon as we get emails or other inquiries, we'd get folks signed up and in the pipeline for vetting (i.e., into our vetting-specific Discord server). Normal pace until November 2024 was, at most, 1-2 signups per week with one vetting session per month.

November 2024, for obvious reasons, resulted in an explosion of interest. For the whole month of November we set a pace of recruitment and intake that was unsustainable and left many prospective members waiting around for vetting for a long time, and even once vetted, were (and continue to be) left waiting for openings in an intro class that meets their skillset and needs.

PSSRA's foremost goal with new members is to immediately provide an opportunity to "touch grass" and make it out to an in-person introductory class as soon as as they make it into the org. Ramping up vetting pace is both tough on our vetting committee, and leads to overloaded onboarding opportunities.

We will get everyone into the intake/vetting process as soon as possible!

## Membership requirements/prohibitions

All vetted chapter members must be age 21+ because of Washington handgun and rifle laws. Before signing up, please see a full list of our other chapter membership prohibitions here: https://pastebin.com/raw/EaAt9ujA

{{< box important >}}
**MEMBERSHIP PROHIBITIONS**

Individuals, unless otherwise decided upon, are prohibited from membership in
the Chapter and/or Organization if:
* The individual is under 21 years of age (due to state handgun and
  semiautomatic rifle laws).
* The individual possesses a recent and/or relevant history of expressing
  sympathy or support for fascism, neoconfederatism, or other reactionary and/or
  discriminatory ideologies.
* The individual actively participates in exclusionary social ideologies,
  including but not limited to: racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia,
  ableism, or religious discrimination.
* The individual has a known history of perpetrating abuse and/or sexual
  assault.
* The individual has expressed clear intent or has clearly and repeatedly acted
  to cause harm to the name or structure of the Chapter and/or Organization.
* The individual has been expelled from other sympathetic or leftist
  organizations for charges related to character or conduct.
* The individual is a member of a militia or paramilitary organization, namely a
  movement that shows express intent to use violence in an illegal manner.
* The individual is currently employed, in a volunteer or paid capacity, as any
  manner of law enforcement or peace officer.

  agencies not connected to intelligence gathering or espionage.)
* The individual directly employs workers and the majority of whose income is
  derived from the labor of others, or through stocks, bonds, or other financial
  assets.

Adherence to a socialist ideology is not a requirement for membership. However,
it should be understood that the core purpose of the Chapter and Organization,
advocating for the working class to develop the means to engage in personal and
community defense, is inherently socialist.


#### MILITARY SERVICE

If you are a military veteran or active duty service member, you are not
necessarily disqualified from membership, but you must let us know via email or
DM our Vetting Chair with that information prior to your vetting session so we
can follow up with a few questions about your service.


#### FIREARMS PROHIBITIONS

In alignment with the Chapter's mission as a firearms education organization
first and foremost, we are currently not admitting individuals for membership
who are legally prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms by the federal
government or the state of Washington.

Potential members must be able to "pass" an ATF Form 4473; please see that form
(link follows) for a full list and list of possible exceptions.

The following list quotes directly from Form 4473 and **does not reflect the
attitudes of the Chapter or Organization.**

Individuals are prohibited from membership in the Chapter if:
* The individual has been convicted of or is under indictment for a felony, or
  or any other crime that could result in a prison sentence of a year or more
* The individual is an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any
  depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.

## Joining National SRA
If you'd like, you can go ahead and join our parent organization at https://socialistra.org, but please know that *we will not be able to provide you vetting into the local chapter* for some time; you will still be part of the same queue. If you do join national, please reply back with your membership number so I can keep an eye out for you on our local roster. If you'd prefer to wait, there are other options for local-only membership.
