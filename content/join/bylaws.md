# BYLAWS OF THE PUGET SOUND SOCIALIST RIFLE ASSOCIATION

*Amended through \[Insert Date Here\]*

## SECTION ZERO: DEFINITIONS AND SUPREMACY {#0}

The Puget Sound Socialist Rifle Association is a chapter of the Socialist Rifle Association. References to the Socialist Rifle Association or "Organization" are to the national umbrella organization, whereas references to the Chapter refer to the Puget Sound Socialist Rifle Association. This Chapter recognizes the supremacy of the Socialist Rifle Association bylaws, as ratified by the Membership of Socialist Rifle Association, and pledges to act in accordance with the Bylaws of the Socialist Rifle Association.

Unless otherwise specified, language referencing membership shall be interpreted to mean dues-paying or recognized dues waived members of the SRA within the jurisdiction of the Chapter, or Local Comrades of the Chapter.

# ARTICLE ONE: CORE FUNCTIONS {#1}

## SECTION ONE: STATEMENT OF INTENT {#1-1}

The Puget Sound Socialist Rifle Association (henceforth The Chapter) promotes and advocates for the right of the poor and working class, people of color, trans and queer people, indigenous peoples, and non-men to self defense and community defense. The Chapter seeks to provide a positive, leftist space for the discussion of firearms and other means of self and community defense. The Chapter will conduct itself ethically and in compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal laws. The Chapter will not advocate for or participate in offensive violence or acts of riot. The Chapter will always strive to be a positive and ethical force in the community to promote socialistic change and inclusiveness.

## SECTION TWO: POINTS OF UNITY {#1-2}

We are working class and poor people dedicated to educating in the safe use of firearms for personal and community self-defense as well as encouraging and enabling education of all manner of skills related to community defense. We are a multi-tendency leftist association of Socialists, Communists, Anarchists, etc., united by class, for our class. We respect one another's political stances and differences, especially when we disagree.

We are dedicated to Liberation and Freedom of ALL people and therefore oppose all forms of oppression and exploitation.

We are a party to our local communities and act as such. We volunteer in various ways to further the connections between leftist political radicals and the unorganized communities in which we live. We aim to improve the material and social conditions of other working class and marginalized folks.

We stand against the disarmament of the working class. We are dedicated to arming the working class, both physically and mentally.

## SECTION THREE: JURISDICTION {#1-3}

### SUBSECTION ONE: CHAPTER JURISDICTION {#1-3-1}

The Chapter will cover the State of Washington.

Comrades in Clark County, Washington may choose to join the Portland Chapter of the SRA instead of the Puget Sound chapter. Portland SRA vetting/ascension will not be reciprocal with Puget Sound SRA. Comrades located in Washington State who are on the Portland SRA national roster may choose to become Local Comrade members of the Puget Sound SRA to gain access to Puget Sound SRA vetting, events, and resources.

Comrades in the state of Idaho who lack a local SRA chapter may choose to join Puget Sound SRA.

### SUBSECTION TWO: REGIONAL JURISDICTION {#1-3-2}

The Chapter shall subdivide the state into 5 regions, which represent the greater geographically distinct areas of the state: Central, North, South, Peninsula, and East. Any of the 5 regions of the Chapter may separate from the Puget Sound SRA and form their own regional chapter under 4 conditions: 1) The proposed regional chapter is able to create their own chapter with operational functionality which meets the needs of their distinct region, 2) the separation of the region into a separate chapter does not impede the function of the Chapter as a whole, 3) the Chapter membership approves the separation with a Bylaws amendment by a vote with not less than two-thirds approval, 4) The separation is approved by the Governing Body of the SRA.

The jurisdiction of the five regions shall be as follows:

North region shall include the following counties: Whatcom, Skagit, Snohomish, San Juan, and Island.

Central region shall include the following counties: King.

South region shall include the following counties: Grays Harbor, Mason, Thurston, Pierce, Pacific, Lewis, Wahkiakum, Cowlitz, Skamania, and Clark.

East region shall include the following counties: Okanogan, Chelan, Kittitas, Yakima, Klickitat, Douglas, Grant, Benton, Ferry, Lincoln, Adams, Franklin, Walla Walla, Stevens, Pend Oreille, Spokane, Whitman, Columbia, Garfield, and Asotin.

Comrades in Idaho will be associated with East region.

Membership of the regions shall be granted with membership of the greater chapter.

In the event of a split, regions which have not formed their own chapter shall continue their relationship as members of the Chapter.

At the point that all 5 regions described herein are able to form their own chapters and have done so under the process described herein, the Puget Sound Chapter of the SRA shall dissolve and the individual chapters shall control their distinct regions under new bylaws according to and approved by the bylaws of the SRA.


# ARTICLE TWO: MEMBERSHIP {#2}

## SECTION ONE: WHO MAY APPLY {#2-1}

Any individual who agrees with this Chapter's purpose and is not disqualified by the limitations listed in Article 3, Section 1 of the national bylaws may join as a provisional member by paying dues to the Socialist Rifle Association. Provisional members shall have access to any extant National SRA resources, but will not have access to Chapter resources, Chapter general meetings, or Chapter in-person events until becoming full members.

The Chapter Central Committee, hereafter CCC, may set forth additional membership requirements and prohibitions in the form of ongoing policy resolutions, to be approved by a majority vote of the CCC.

### SUBSECTION ONE: LOCAL COMRADES {#2-1-1}

Individuals falling within the geographic boundaries of the Chapter who do not wish to join the National level Organization may elect to become a **Local Comrade** of the Chapter.

After providing a donation to the Chapter (with annual or monthly amount determined by the Treasurer in consultation with the remaining members of the Chapter Central Committee) they become a provisional local comrade of the chapter. Provisional local comrades will not have access to Chapter resources, Chapter general meetings, or Chapter in-person events until becoming full local comrades.

Except as otherwise explicitly stated, all provisions of the Chapter bylaws pertaining to Chapter members also pertain to Chapter local comrades, including but not limited to: access to internal communications; ability to serve on committees or in leadership roles other than Liaison, Secretary, and Treasurer; and access to in-person range days and events.

All membership disqualifications, codes of conduct, and disciplinary procedures that apply to members also apply to local comrades.

## SECTION TWO: PROVISIONAL MEMBER ASCENSION {#2-2}

To become a full member or full local comrade of the Organization and the Chapter, a provisional member or provisional local comrade shall undergo a vetting process. A provisional member or provisional local comrade shall be contacted by the Secretary and provided with the ability to attend a vetting interview, either in-person or virtual call with video for the provisional member or provisional local comrade. The Chapter Vetting Chair will assign three or more members of the Vetting Committee to attend the interview. The Secretary or Vetting Chair may serve on the Vetting Committee.

This interview shall consist, at minimum, of questions establishing the provisional member's alignment with the goals of the Chapter and Organization, and confirmation that they are not subject to any membership prohibitions of the Chapter or Organization. The Vetting Chair will maintain an up-to-date Standard Operating Procedure with specific questions to ask the new provisional member or provisional local comrade.

Following the interview, the members of the Committee that conducted the interview shall discuss the results with one another. If it is decided that the provisional member should be welcomed into the Chapter, the member shall be notified and invited into the Chapter's internal communications platform. If it is decided that further confirmation is warranted, the interviewers shall confer with the Vetting Chair, Chapter Secretary, and the rest of the Committee about the interview. If it is determined by the broader Committee that the provisional member should be welcomed into the Chapter, then they shall be notified as stipulated above. The Committee shall determine if there are follow-up questions to be asked of the provisional member in an attempt to resolve the Committee's concerns. If the Committee determines that the provisional member should not be welcomed into the Chapter, all communications with the provisional member shall cease following notification of their denial.

After successful vetting, provisional members and provisional local comrades become full members and full local comrades, respectively, of the Chapter. Members (not local comrades) shall be nominated for ascension with the national Organization, vouched for by the Secretary and the Vetting Chair.

The Chapter may enact further clarifying policies on the vetting process by majority vote of the CCC, as proposed by the Vetting Chair or Chapter Secretary.

MWC matters include, but are not limited to, issues between members, officers and members, and officers themselves that may affect organizational participation or the ability to provide instruction. The purpose of the MWC should align with the chapter’s established expectations for conduct, which include principles such as engaging in good faith.

MWC involvement and makeup should be guided by an internal policy that is communicated proactively to the membership and grounded in the Organization and Chapter's mission and vision, specifically, commitments to carceral abolition, restorative and transformative justice, and an understanding of marginalization. The internal policy should outline what documentation for exclusionary and restorative actions should look like, as well as a plain language map of what escalated consequences can look like in the event of ongoing and egregious behavior.

The MWC should not be considered a last resort; rather, it should be utilized proactively to address issues early whenever possible. The MWC has the authority to make recommendations, lead investigations, gather relevant evidence, and present findings to the combined CCC and CRC when larger actions are required, in accordance with the designated section and subsection. Members of the MWC can also be moderators or hold other roles, and any actions in the role of MWC should be made clear.
