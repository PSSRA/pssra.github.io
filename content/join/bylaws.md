# BYLAWS OF THE PUGET SOUND SOCIALIST RIFLE ASSOCIATION

*Amended through \[Insert Date Here\]*

## SECTION ZERO: DEFINITIONS AND SUPREMACY

The Puget Sound Socialist Rifle Association is a chapter of the Socialist Rifle Association. References to the Socialist Rifle Association or "Organization" are to the national umbrella organization, whereas references to the Chapter refer to the Puget Sound Socialist Rifle Association. This Chapter recognizes the supremacy of the Socialist Rifle Association bylaws, as ratified by the Membership of Socialist Rifle Association, and pledges to act in accordance with the Bylaws of the Socialist Rifle Association.

Unless otherwise specified, language referencing membership shall be interpreted to mean dues-paying or recognized dues waived members of the SRA within the jurisdiction of the Chapter, or Local Comrades of the Chapter.

# ARTICLE ONE: CORE FUNCTIONS

## SECTION ONE: STATEMENT OF INTENT

The Puget Sound Socialist Rifle Association (henceforth The Chapter) promotes and advocates for the right of the poor and working class, people of color, trans and queer people, indigenous peoples, and non-men to self defense and community defense. The Chapter seeks to provide a positive, leftist space for the discussion of firearms and other means of self and community defense. The Chapter will conduct itself ethically and in compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal laws. The Chapter will not advocate for or participate in offensive violence or acts of riot. The Chapter will always strive to be a positive and ethical force in the community to promote socialistic change and inclusiveness.

## SECTION TWO: POINTS OF UNITY

We are working class and poor people dedicated to educating in the safe use of firearms for personal and community self-defense as well as encouraging and enabling education of all manner of skills related to community defense. We are a multi-tendency leftist association of Socialists, Communists, Anarchists, etc., united by class, for our class. We respect one another's political stances and differences, especially when we disagree.

We are dedicated to Liberation and Freedom of ALL people and therefore oppose all forms of oppression and exploitation.

We are a party to our local communities and act as such. We volunteer in various ways to further the connections between leftist political radicals and the unorganized communities in which we live. We aim to improve the material and social conditions of other working class and marginalized folks.

We stand against the disarmament of the working class. We are dedicated to arming the working class, both physically and mentally.

## SECTION THREE: JURISDICTION

### SUBSECTION ONE: CHAPTER JURISDICTION

The Chapter will cover the State of Washington.

Comrades in Clark County, Washington may choose to join the Portland Chapter of the SRA instead of the Puget Sound chapter. Portland SRA vetting/ascension will not be reciprocal with Puget Sound SRA. Comrades on the Portland SRA roster may choose to become Local Comrade members of the Puget Sound SRA to gain access to Puget Sound SRA vetting, events, and resources.

Comrades in the state of Idaho who lack a local SRA chapter may choose to join Puget Sound SRA.

### SUBSECTION TWO: REGIONAL JURISDICTION

The Chapter shall subdivide the state into 5 regions, which represent the greater geographically distinct areas of the state: Central, North, South, Peninsula, and East. Any of the 5 rections of the Chapter may separate from the Puget Sound SRA and form their own regional chapter under 4 conditions: 1) The proposed regional chapter is able to create their own chapter with operational functionality which meets the needs of their distinct region, 2) the separation of the region into a separate chapter does not impede the function of the Chapter as a whole, 3) the Chapter membership approves the separation with a Bylaws amendment by a vote with not less than two-thirds approval, 4) The separation is approved by the Governing Body of the SRA.

The jurisdiction of the five regions shall be as follows:

North region shall include the following counties: Whatcom, Skagit, Snohomish, San Juan, and Island.

Central region shall include the following counties: King.

South region shall include the following counties: Grays Harbor, Mason, Thurston, Pierce, Pacific, Lewis, Wahkiakum, Cowlitz, Skamania, and Clark.

Peninsula region shall include the following counties: Clallam, Jefferson, Kitsap.

East region shall include the following counties: Okanogan, Chelan, Kittitas, Yakima, Klickitat, Douglas, Grant, Benton, Ferry, Lincoln, Adams, Franklin, Walla Walla, Stevens, Pend Oreille, Spokane, Whitman, Columbia, Garfield, and Asotin.

Comrades in Idaho will be associated with East region.

Membership of the regions shall be granted with membership of the greater chapter.

In the event of a split, regions which have not formed their own chapter shall continue their relationship as members of the Chapter.

At the point that all 5 regions described herein are able to form their own chapters and have done so under the process described herein, the Puget Sound Chapter of the SRA shall dissolve and the individual chapters shall control their distinct regions under new bylaws according to and approved by the bylaws of the SRA.

# ARTICLE TWO: CONDUCT

## SECTION ONE: CODE OF CONDUCT

Members are expected to follow basic rules of conduct while at events being hosted or participated in by the Chapter. Failure to adhere to these rules can be grounds for disciplinary action, ranging from informal warnings up to expulsion as outlined in these bylaws.

## SECTION TWO: MEMBERSHIP CONDUCT

Members are expected to be respectful to others at all times. Feuding and fighting does not benefit the organization.

Members will not make any public statement on behalf of the chapter as a whole without the consent of the Chapter Central Committee (hereafter referred to as CCC, defined in Article 4) and/or unanimous consent of all Chapter members not serving on the CCC.

Members will not violate the privacy of any members by committing acts such as, but not limited to: sharing personal, identifying information of other members and posting or sharing photos or videos exposing the identity of other members. If members wish to share information about other members, they are expected to only act upon the explicit consent of the members to be identified.

### SUBSECTION ONE: DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT, AND VIOLENCE

The Socialist Rifle Association is an inclusive organization. Discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity, race, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, political beliefs, or disability is not allowed. Due to the fact that some political or religious beliefs are incompatible with this rule, members who voice support for fascism or other discriminatory ideologies will be sanctioned appropriately, up to and including expulsion.

Not adhering to a purely socialistic ideology is not grounds for expulsion from the membership. Any individual may be a member if they agree with the core mission statement of advocating for the working class to possess arms for defense of self and the community. It should be understood, however, that the purpose of this is for socialistic ends.

Harassing, menacing, violent, or retaliatory behaviors of any kind will not be tolerated. Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature which makes a person feel offended, humiliated, or intimidated and will not be tolerated. Any expression of sexual harassment and/or violence whether it be physical, verbal, or nonverbal will not be tolerated.

The Chapter encourages confidential reporting of all perceived incidents of misconduct, including but not limited to discrimination, harassment, menacing, retaliation, or violence, regardless of the offender's identity or position within the organization. Any member may at any time present a grievance of misconduct to any member of the CCC or CWC Chair(s), who will keep it in strict confidence. Should the member not feel comfortable presenting this grievance to the CCC or CWC Chair(s), they have the right to speak directly and privately to the National Welfare Council (NWC). As such, any offending members facing allegations of misconduct both within and without the Organization will be sanctioned appropriately, up to and including expulsion.

Any individual found to be an abuser or to have engaged in harassment or expressed racist, sexist, fascist, reactionary, or exclusionary social ideologies outside of the organization will be considered for expulsion from the organization.

When any member is expelled from the organization for misconduct, announcement of membership termination of said member will be announced for security reasons. This announcement will be made on approval of any other involved members at the earliest opportunity.

### SUBSECTION TWO: USE OF MIND-ALTERING SUBSTANCES

Use of, or being under the influence of, alcohol and/or other mind-altering recreational substances is prohibited at in-person Chapter-sponsored events including but not limited to general meetings, skills workshops, and range days. It is each member's own responsibility to ensure they are physically and mentally capable of safely operating a firearm.

However, the presence and consumption of alcoholic drinks are allowed during Chapter sponsored social events only if the following criteria are met: (1) Absolutely no firearms, ammunition, or firearms parts are present, including concealed carry, (2) a general consensus is met by the attending members for the allowance of alcoholic drinks, and (3) the member(s) providing the alcoholic drink notifies the membership what they will be bringing prior to the event.

## SECTION THREE: FIREARM CONDUCT

Members should understand that the Socialist Rifle Association advocates for the use and responsible proliferation of firearms for the defense of self and the community. When members are using firearms at Chapter events or in personal use, they must always observe the four rules of firearms:

- ASSUME LOADED: Treat all firearms as if they are loaded until personally verifying otherwise.

- CONTROL MUZZLE: Never point a firearm at anything you are not willing to kill or destroy.

- AWAY FROM TRIGGER: Never place your finger on the trigger until you are ready to fire.

- BEYOND TARGET: Be aware of your target and what is behind it.

Members must be aware of local firearm regulations and applicable laws. The Chapter will work to provide resources on these topics.

At the time of these bylaws' writing, convicted felons, people convicted of certain misdemeanors, and those who have been served with a restraining order are prohibited from possessing handguns in the State of Washington until a court restores their rights. Those convicted of domestic violence also have their right to possess firearms restricted. It is the responsibility of the member to ensure they may lawfully possess a firearm and disclose to the CCC or CWC Chair(s) (see Article Two, Section Four) if this status changes.

Should any member of the CCC learn that a member is in possession of a firearm unlawfully, that CCC member will report to the remainder of the CCC and/or CWC Chair(s), who will restrict the member from participating in firearm-related activities until the situation can be discussed with the member and resolved.

Guests of members (limited to 2 guests per member) and/or members of guest organizations may be permitted to attend range days or other firearms related trainings or events, at the discretion of the event organizer and FTC (firearms training committee), provided that they have not been barred by the chapter due to misconduct.

### SUBSECTION ONE: ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP

Members are expected to act as responsible stewards of the environment and the lands on which they meet. This includes but is not limited to packing out all trash and targets from outdoor range days or other outdoor activities, and not using firearms or setting campfires under conditions or in a way that presents the risk of starting wildfires.

## SECTION FOUR: REPORTING PROCESS

Members may report violations of these codes of conduct to any member of the CCC, who shall then investigate the report by questioning relevant persons. The CCC shall be empowered to include any appropriate persons with expertise or experience in the issue in this temporary subcommittee, known as the Chapter Welfare Committee (hereafter referred to as the CWC).

The CCC may appoint an ongoing CWC Chair (or multiple co-chairs) with standing responsibility to collect reports and assemble and facilitate future CWC(s).

Following the conclusion of each investigation, the CWC shall present a recommendation to chapter leadership of restorative action. Chapter leadership shall come to a consensus whether to execute the CWC's recommendation, or shall come to a consensus on a different recommendation, which the CWC shall duly implement. Should the member not feel comfortable presenting this grievance to the CCC or CWC Chair(s), they have the right to speak directly and privately to the National Welfare Council.

All reports of misconduct and outcomes of CWC investigations will be retained in Chapter records for a period no less than three years in a location/format inaccessible to members other than CCC members under a National Organization NDA. CCC may set a records retention policy for regular purge of these reports three or more years old.

## SECTION FIVE: DISCIPLINARY MEASURES

The measures available to the membership for addressing violations of the Chapter's Code of Conduct shall include, but should not be considered to be limited to the following:

1.  A warning to the offending person.

2.  One or more restorative measures, to be completed as promptly as possible.

3.  A temporary ban from interaction with the affected person(s).

4.  A temporary censure from Chapter Events.

5.  Temporary expulsion from the Organization.

6.  Permanent expulsion from the Organization.

These measures should not be considered mutually exclusive by default, and in all cases except permanent expulsion, the offender shall always have the ability to adhere to agreed-upon restorative measures to address their harm. This agreement may be mediated by the CWC, the membership as a whole, by certain members selected by the affected person(s), or not at all, according to the express wishes of the affected person(s). However, completion of these measures shall in no way obligate a return to pre-existing relationships prior to the disciplinary measure(s) being implemented, and in no way does this imply that completing one measure means that another measure, being previously agreed on, does not need to be completed.


## SECTION SIX: MEMBERSHIP

Any individual who agrees with this Chapter's purpose and is not disqualified by the limitations listed in Article 3, Section 1 of the national bylaws may join as a provisional member by paying dues to the Socialist Rifle Association. Provisional members shall have access to any extant National SRA resources, but will not have access to Chapter resources, Chapter general meetings, or Chapter in-person events until becoming full members.

Individuals falling within the geographic boundaries of the Chapter who do not wish to join the National level Organization may elect to become a **Local Comrade** of the Chapter. After providing a donation to the Chapter (with annual or monthly amount determined by the Treasurer in consultation with the remaining members of the CCC) they become a provisional local comrade of the chapter. Provisional local comrades will not have access to Chapter resources, Chapter general meetings, or Chapter in-person events until becoming full local comrades. Except as otherwise explicitly stated, all provisions of the Chapter bylaws pertaining to Chapter members also pertain to Chapter local comrades, including but not limited to: access to internal communications; ability to serve on committees or in leadership roles other than Liaison, Secretary, and Treasurer; and access to in-person range days and events. All membership disqualifications that apply to members also apply to local comrades.

### SUBSECTION ONE: PROVISIONAL MEMBER ASCENSION

To become a full member or full local comrade of the Organization and the Chapter, a provisional member or provisional local comrade shall undergo a vetting process. A provisional member or provisional local comrade shall be contacted by the Secretary and provided with the ability to attend a vetting interview, either in-person or virtual call with video for the provisional member or provisional local comrade. The Chapter Vetting Chair will assign three or more members of the Vetting Committee to attend the interview. The Secretary or Vetting Chair may serve on the Vetting Committee.

This interview shall consist, at minimum, of questions establishing the provisional member's alignment with the goals of the Chapter and Organization, and confirmation that they are not subject to any membership prohibitions of the Chapter or Organization. The Vetting Chair will maintain an up-to-date Standard Operating Procedure with specific questions to ask the new provisional member or provisional local comrade. Other full members or full local comrades of the Chapter may suggest new questions to the Vetting Chair.

Following the interview, the members of the Committee that conducted the interview shall discuss the results with one another. If it is decided that the provisional member should be welcomed into the Chapter, the member shall be notified and invited into the Chapter's internal communications platform. If it is decided that further confirmation is warranted, the interviewers shall confer with the Vetting Chair, Chapter Secretary, and the rest of the Committee about the interview. If it is determined by the broader Committee that the provisional member should be welcomed into the Chapter, then they shall be notified as stipulated above. The Committee shall determine if there are follow-up questions to be asked of the provisional member in an attempt to resolve the Committee's concerns. If the Committee determines that the provisional member should not be welcomed into the Chapter, all communications with the provisional member shall cease.

After successful vetting, provisional members and provisional local comrades become full members and full local comrades, respectively, of the Chapter. Members (not local comrades) shall be nominated for ascension with the national Organization, vouched for by the Secretary and the Vetting Chair.

The Chapter may enact further clarifying policies on the vetting process by majority vote of the CCC, as proposed by the Vetting Chair or Chapter Secretary.

### SUBSECTION TWO: IN-PERSON EVENT ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS

The CCC may elect to gate some non-educational Chapter resources and discussion fora behind attending an in-person educational event, requirements for which are at the CCC and firearms training committee's discretion. At the CCC and firearms training committees discretion, the CCC may choose an expiration period after a member's last in-person class attendance at which time the member loses access to these non-educational resources.

### SUBSECTION THREE: GOOD STANDING

All Chapter members must remain in good standing with the Organization, and continue to appear on rosters as provided from the Organization to the Chapter Secretary.

Chapter local comrades must maintain direct donations to the Chapter as determined by the Chapter Treasurer, or request waivers of same, with written procedures for doing so established by the Chapter Treasurer and available to all members.

### SUBSECTION FOUR: EXPULSION

A member or local comrade may lose their role in the Chapter by resigning or by expulsion from the group.

Disciplinary expulsion (temporary or permanent) can take place as part of a disciplinary procedure decided upon by the Chapter Welfare Committee with majority approval from CCC after a discussion period of no less than 48 hours. Under emergency circumstances, including but not limited to threat to well-being of members, the Organization, or the Chapter, the CWC may remove access to Chapter resources during this discussion period.

Administrative expulsion (temporary or permanent) may be enacted by the Secretary and/or Treasurer for administrative reasons such as dues arrears, removal from National roster, or being legally unable to attend Chapter events.

If a national member is expelled from the chapter for disciplinary reasons, the Liaison shall recommend the member's expulsion from the Organization to the National Welfare Council, requiring a second from the Secretary.

## SECTION SEVEN: VOTING

Voting may take place for (a) installation or removal of chapter officers, (b) changes to non-bylaws policies and procedures (see Article Seven), or (c) amendments to chapter bylaws. Votes may take place publicly or confidentially. All votes concerning leadership will be held confidentially. It is at the discretion of the leadership on how to hold a vote, however any member can request a confidential vote for any reason, at which time the leadership will provide a mechanism for it.

# ARTICLE THREE: AMENDMENTS

Bylaws may be amended, added, or removed by a two-thirds majority vote by the membership, with quorum of no less than 25% of active vetted members. A period of at least two weeks will be given for this to be completed, and all available communication methods shall be utilized to solicit responses.

Interim members may themselves call for an election to become permanent, or other full members of the Chapter may self-nominate and call for an election to replace them in the role, at any time, to be held within 30 days.

### SUBSECTION ONE: UNAFFILIATED COALITION WORK

Neither the Chapter nor the Organization need officially sanction membership involvement in ongoing projects that align with the overall mission of the Organization in their community as individuals, and therefore they shall not be conducted under either the Chapter or Organization's name.
