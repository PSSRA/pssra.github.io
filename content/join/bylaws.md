# BYLAWS OF THE PUGET SOUND SOCIALIST RIFLE ASSOCIATION

*Amended through \[Insert Date Here\]*

## SECTION ZERO: DEFINITIONS AND SUPREMACY

The Puget Sound Socialist Rifle Association is a chapter of the Socialist Rifle Association. References to the Socialist Rifle Association or "Organization" are to the national umbrella organization, whereas references to the Chapter refer to the Puget Sound Socialist Rifle Association. This Chapter recognizes the supremacy of the Socialist Rifle Association bylaws, as ratified by the Membership of Socialist Rifle Association, and pledges to act in accordance with the Bylaws of the Socialist Rifle Association.

Unless otherwise specified, language referencing membership shall be interpreted to mean dues-paying or recognized dues waived members of the SRA within the jurisdiction of the Chapter, or Local Comrades of the Chapter.

# ARTICLE ONE: CORE FUNCTIONS

## SECTION ONE: STATEMENT OF INTENT

The Puget Sound Socialist Rifle Association (henceforth The Chapter) promotes and advocates for the right of the poor and working class, people of color, trans and queer people, indigenous peoples, and non-men to self defense and community defense. The Chapter seeks to provide a positive, leftist space for the discussion of firearms and other means of self and community defense. The Chapter will conduct itself ethically and in compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal laws. The Chapter will not advocate for or participate in offensive violence or acts of riot. The Chapter will always strive to be a positive and ethical force in the community to promote socialistic change and inclusiveness.

## SECTION TWO: POINTS OF UNITY

We are working class and poor people dedicated to educating in the safe use of firearms for personal and community self-defense as well as encouraging and enabling education of all manner of skills related to community defense. We are a multi-tendency leftist association of Socialists, Communists, Anarchists, etc., united by class, for our class. We respect one another's political stances and differences, especially when we disagree.

We are dedicated to Liberation and Freedom of ALL people and therefore oppose all forms of oppression and exploitation.

We are a party to our local communities and act as such. We volunteer in various ways to further the connections between leftist political radicals and the unorganized communities in which we live. We aim to improve the material and social conditions of other working class and marginalized folks.

We stand against the disarmament of the working class. We are dedicated to arming the working class, both physically and mentally.

## SECTION THREE: JURISDICTION

### SUBSECTION ONE: CHAPTER JURISDICTION

The Chapter will cover the State of Washington.

Comrades in Clark County, Washington may choose to join the Portland Chapter of the SRA instead of the Puget Sound chapter. Portland SRA vetting/ascension will not be reciprocal with Puget Sound SRA. Comrades on the Portland SRA roster may choose to become Local Comrade members of the Puget Sound SRA to gain access to Puget Sound SRA vetting, events, and resources.

Comrades in the state of Idaho who lack a local SRA chapter may choose to join Puget Sound SRA.

### SUBSECTION TWO: REGIONAL JURISDICTION

The Chapter shall subdivide the state into 5 regions, which represent the greater geographically distinct areas of the state: Central, North, South, Peninsula, and East. Any of the 5 rections of the Chapter may separate from the Puget Sound SRA and form their own regional chapter under 4 conditions: 1) The proposed regional chapter is able to create their own chapter with operational functionality which meets the needs of their distinct region, 2) the separation of the region into a separate chapter does not impede the function of the Chapter as a whole, 3) the Chapter membership approves the separation with a Bylaws amendment by a vote with not less than two-thirds approval, 4) The separation is approved by the Governing Body of the SRA.

The jurisdiction of the five regions shall be as follows:

North region shall include the following counties: Whatcom, Skagit, Snohomish, San Juan, and Island.

Membership of the regions shall be granted with membership of the greater chapter.

In the event of a split, regions which have not formed their own chapter shall continue their relationship as members of the Chapter.

At the point that all 5 regions described herein are able to form their own chapters and have done so under the process described herein, the Puget Sound Chapter of the SRA shall dissolve and the individual chapters shall control their distinct regions under new bylaws according to and approved by the bylaws of the SRA.


# ARTICLE TWO: MEMBERSHIP

## SECTION ONE: WHO MAY APPLY

Any individual who agrees with this Chapter's purpose and is not disqualified by the limitations listed in Article 3, Section 1 of the national bylaws may join as a provisional member by paying dues to the Socialist Rifle Association. Provisional members shall have access to any extant National SRA resources, but will not have access to Chapter resources, Chapter general meetings, or Chapter in-person events until becoming full members.

Individuals falling within the geographic boundaries of the Chapter who do not wish to join the National level Organization may elect to become a **Local Comrade** of the Chapter. After providing a donation to the Chapter (with annual or monthly amount determined by the Treasurer in consultation with the remaining members of the CCC) they become a provisional local comrade of the chapter. Provisional local comrades will not have access to Chapter resources, Chapter general meetings, or Chapter in-person events until becoming full local comrades. Except as otherwise explicitly stated, all provisions of the Chapter bylaws pertaining to Chapter members also pertain to Chapter local comrades, including but not limited to: access to internal communications; ability to serve on committees or in leadership roles other than Liaison, Secretary, and Treasurer; and access to in-person range days and events. All membership disqualifications that apply to members also apply to local comrades.

The Chapter Central Committee may set forth additional membership requirements and prohibitions in the form of ongoing policy resolutions, to be approved by a majority vote of the CCC.

## SECTION TWO: PROVISIONAL MEMBER ASCENSION

To become a full member or full local comrade of the Organization and the Chapter, a provisional member or provisional local comrade shall undergo a vetting process. A provisional member or provisional local comrade shall be contacted by the Secretary and provided with the ability to attend a vetting interview, either in-person or virtual call with video for the provisional member or provisional local comrade. The Chapter Vetting Chair will assign three or more members of the Vetting Committee to attend the interview. The Secretary or Vetting Chair may serve on the Vetting Committee.

This interview shall consist, at minimum, of questions establishing the provisional member's alignment with the goals of the Chapter and Organization, and confirmation that they are not subject to any membership prohibitions of the Chapter or Organization. The Vetting Chair will maintain an up-to-date Standard Operating Procedure with specific questions to ask the new provisional member or provisional local comrade. Other full members or full local comrades of the Chapter may suggest new questions to the Vetting Chair.

Following the interview, the members of the Committee that conducted the interview shall discuss the results with one another. If it is decided that the provisional member should be welcomed into the Chapter, the member shall be notified and invited into the Chapter's internal communications platform. If it is decided that further confirmation is warranted, the interviewers shall confer with the Vetting Chair, Chapter Secretary, and the rest of the Committee about the interview. If it is determined by the broader Committee that the provisional member should be welcomed into the Chapter, then they shall be notified as stipulated above. The Committee shall determine if there are follow-up questions to be asked of the provisional member in an attempt to resolve the Committee's concerns. If the Committee determines that the provisional member should not be welcomed into the Chapter, all communications with the provisional member shall cease.

After successful vetting, provisional members and provisional local comrades become full members and full local comrades, respectively, of the Chapter. Members (not local comrades) shall be nominated for ascension with the national Organization, vouched for by the Secretary and the Vetting Chair.

The Chapter may enact further clarifying policies on the vetting process by majority vote of the CCC, as proposed by the Vetting Chair or Chapter Secretary.

## SECTION THREE: CONDUCT 

Members of the Chapter are expected to adhere to certain rules, policies, and standards of conduct when acting within the Chapter and when representing the Chapter. Certain forms of misconduct may be considered so egregious as to be grounds for discipline even if a member is not representing the Chapter or Organization.

The Chapter Central Committee may set forth additional standards of conduct in the form of ongoing policy resolutions, so long as they do not violate any enumerated member rights.

All members are expected to comply with the following standards of conduct:

1. Participating in harassment campaigns, threats of violence, or derogatory behavior is forbidden.

Under emergency circumstances, including but not limited to threat to well-being of members, the Organization, or the Chapter, the CWC may remove access to Chapter resources during this discussion period.

Administrative expulsion (temporary or permanent) may be enacted by the Secretary and/or Treasurer for administrative reasons such as dues arrears, removal from National roster, or being legally unable to attend Chapter events. This expulsion shall be reversed when the situation is resolved. The CCC and Vetting Chair may institute a policy whereby after a specified period of membership lapse the member must undergo re-vetting.

If a national member is expelled from the chapter for disciplinary reasons, the Liaison shall recommend the member's expulsion from the Organization to the National Welfare Council, requiring a second from the Secretary.
