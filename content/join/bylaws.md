*Amended through \[Insert Date Here\]*

## SECTION ZERO: DEFINITIONS AND SUPREMACY

The Puget Sound Socialist Rifle Association is a chapter of the Socialist Rifle Association. References to the Socialist Rifle Association or "Organization" are to the national umbrella organization, whereas references to the Chapter refer to the Socialist Rifle Association of Wichita. This Chapter recognizes the supremacy of the Socialist Rifle Association bylaws, as ratified by the Membership of Socialist Rifle Association, and pledges to act in accordance with the Bylaws of the Socialist Rifle Association.

Unless otherwise specified, language referencing membership shall be interpreted to mean dues-paying or recognized dues waived members of the SRA within the jurisdiction of the chapter.

# ARTICLE ONE: CORE FUNCTIONS

## SECTION ONE: STATEMENT OF INTENT

The Puget Sound Socialist Rifle Association (henceforth The Chapter) promotes and advocates for the right of the poor and working class, people of color, trans and queer people, indigenous peoples, and non-men \[please remember to be inclusive to marginalized communities\] to self defense and community defense. The Chapter seeks to provide a positive, leftist space for the discussion of firearms and other means of self and community defense. The Chapter additionally seeks to provide members with the ability to learn other valuable skills, such as first aid, radio operation, disaster response, and community advocacy. The Chapter will conduct itself ethically and in compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal laws. The Chapter will not advocate for or participate in offensive violence or acts of riot. The Chapter will always strive to be a positive and ethical force in the community to promote socialistic change and inclusiveness.

## SECTION TWO: POINTS OF UNITY

We are working class and poor people dedicated to educating our class in the safe use of firearms for personal and community self-defense as well as encouraging and enabling education of all manner of skills related to community defense such as disaster relief, medicine, and agriculture. We are a multi-tendency association of Social Democrats, Communists, and Anarchists, etc. united by class, for our class. We respect one another's political stances and differences, especially when we disagree.

We are dedicated to Liberation and Freedom of ALL people and therefore oppose all forms of oppression and exploitation.

We are a party to our local communities and act as such. We volunteer in various ways to further the connections between leftist political radicals and the unorganized communities in which we live. We aim to improve the material and social conditions of other working class and marginalized folks.

We stand against the disarmament of the working class. We are dedicated to arming the working class, both physically and mentally.

## SECTION THREE: JURISDICTION

At the point that all 5 regions described herein are able to form their own chapters and have done so under the process described herein, the Puget Sound Chapter of the SRA shall dissolve and the individual chapters shall control their distinct regions under new bylaws according to and approved by the bylaws of the SRA.

# ARTICLE TWO: CONDUCT

## SECTION ONE: CODE OF CONDUCT

Members are expected to follow basic rules of conduct while at meetings or at events being hosted or participated in by the Chapter. Failure to adhere to these rules can be grounds for disciplinary action, ranging from informal warnings up to a vote to expel the member as outlined in these bylaws.

## SECTION TWO: MEMBERSHIP CONDUCT

Members are expected to be respectful to others at all times. Feuding and fighting does not benefit the organization or the movement.

Members will not make any public statement on behalf of the chapter as a whole without the unanimous consent of the CCC and/or unanimous consent of all Chapter members not serving on the CCC.

Members will not violate the privacy of any members by committing acts such as, but not limited to: sharing personal, identifying information of other members and posting or sharing photos or videos exposing the identity of other members. If members wish to share information about other members, they are expected to only act upon the explicit consent of the members to be identified.

### SUBSECTION ONE: DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT, AND VIOLENCE

The Socialist Rifle Association is an inclusive organization. Discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity, race, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, political beliefs, or disability is not allowed. Due to the fact that some political beliefs are incompatible with this rule, members who voice support for fascism or other discriminatory political ideologies will be sanctioned appropriately, up to and including expulsion.

Not adhering to a purely socialistic ideology is not grounds for expulsion from the membership. Any individual may be a member if they agree with the core mission statement of advocating for the working class to possess arms for defense of self and the community. It should be understood, however, that the purpose of this is for socialistic ends.

Harassing, menacing, violent, or retaliatory behaviors of any kind will not be tolerated. Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature which makes a person feel offended, humiliated, or intimidated and will not be tolerated. Any expression of sexual harassment and/or violence whether it be physical, verbal, or nonverbal will not be tolerated.

The Chapter encourages confidential reporting of all perceived incidents of discrimination, harassment, menacing, retaliation, or violence, regardless of the offender's identity or position within the organization. Any member may at any time present a grievance of discrimination, harassment, menacing, retaliation or sexual harassment to any member of the CCC, who will keep it in strict confidence. Should the member not feel comfortable presenting this grievance to the CCC, they have the right to speak directly and privately to the National Member Welfare Council. As such, any offending members facing allegations of misconduct both within and without the Organization will be sanctioned appropriately, up to and including expulsion.

Any individual found to be an abuser or to have engaged in harassment or expressed racist, sexist, fascist, reactionary, or exclusionary social ideologies outside of the organization will be considered for expulsion from the organization by the consensus of the membership.

When any member is expelled from the organization, announcement of membership termination of said member will be announced for security reasons. This announcement will be made on approval of any other involved members at the earliest opportunity.

### SUBSECTION TWO: USE OF MIND-ALTERING SUBSTANCES

Use of alcohol and other mind altering recreational substances as well as being under the influence of alcohol or such substances is prohibited at Chapter sponsored events including but not limited to general meetings, skills workshops, and range days. It is each member's own responsibility to ensure they are physically and mentally capable of safely operating a firearm.

However, the presence and consumption of alcoholic drinks is allowed during Chapter sponsored social events only if the following criteria is met: (1) Absolutely no firearms, ammunition, or firearms parts are present, including concealed carry, (2) a general consensus is met by the attending members for the allowance of alcoholic drinks, and (3) the member(s) providing the alcoholic drink notifies the membership what they will be bringing prior to the event.

## SECTION THREE: FIREARM CONDUCT

Members should understand that the Socialist Rifle Association advocates for the use and responsible proliferation of firearms for the defense of self and the community. When members are using firearms at Chapter events or in personal use, they must always observe the four rules of firearms:

- All guns are always loaded.

- Never point a firearm at anything you are not willing to kill or destroy.

- Never place your finger on the trigger until you are ready to fire.

- Always know what is behind your target.

Members must be aware of local firearm regulations and applicable laws. The Chapter will work to provide resources on these topics.

At the time of these bylaws' writing, convicted felons, people convicted of certain misdemeanors, and those who have been served with a restraining order are prohibited from possessing handguns in the State of Washington until a court restores their rights. Those convicted of domestic violence also have their right to possess firearms restricted. It is the responsibility of the member to ensure they may lawfully possess a firearm.

Should any member in a leadership role learn that a member is in possession of a firearm unlawfully, that leader will restrict the member from participating in firearm-related activities until the situation can be discussed with the member and resolved.

Guests of members (limited to 2 guests per member) and/or members of guest organizations may be permitted to attend range days or other firearms related trainings or events, at the discretion of the event organizer, provided that they have not been barred by the chapter due to misconduct.

### SUBSECTION ONE: ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP

Members are expected to act as responsible stewards of the environment and the lands on which they meet. This includes but is not limited to:

1.  Always packing out all trash and targets from outdoor range days or other outdoor activities

2.  Not using firearms under conditions or in a way that presents the risk of starting wildfires

## SECTION FOUR: REPORTING PROCESS

Members may report violations of these codes of conduct to any member of the CCC, who shall then investigate the report by questioning relevant persons. The CCC shall be empowered to include any appropriate persons with particular expertise or experience in the issue in this temporary subcommittee, known as the Chapter Member Welfare Committee (hereafter referred to as the CMWC). The CCC may appoint an ongoing CMWC Chair (or multiple co-chairs) to collect reports and assemble and facilitate the committee. Following the conclusion of the investigation, the CMWC shall present a recommendation to chapter leadership of restorative action. Chapter leadership shall come to a consensus whether to execute the CMWC's recommendation, or shall come to a consensus on a different recommendation, which the CMWC shall duly implement. Should the member not feel comfortable presenting this grievance to the CCC or CMWC Chair(s), they have the right to speak directly and privately to the National Member Welfare Council.

## SECTION FIVE: DISCIPLINARY MEASURES

The measures available to the membership for addressing violations of the Chapter's Code of Conduct shall include, but should not be considered to be limited to the following:

1.  A warning to the offending person.

2.  One or more restorative measures, to be completed as promptly as possible.

3.  A temporary ban from interaction with the affected person(s).

4.  A temporary censure from Chapter Events.

5.  Temporary expulsion from the Organization.

6.  Permanent expulsion from the Organization.

These measures should not be considered mutually exclusive by default, and in all cases except permanent expulsion, the offender shall always have the ability to adhere to agreed-upon restorative measures to address their harm. This agreement may be mediated by the CWMC, the membership as a whole, by certain members selected by the affected person(s), or not at all, according to the express wishes of the affected person(s). However, completion of these measures shall in no way obligate a return to pre-existing relationships prior to the disciplinary measure(s) being implemented, and in no way does this imply that completing one measure means that another measure, being previously agreed on, does not need to be completed.


## SECTION SIX: MEMBERSHIP

Any individual who agrees with this Chapter's purpose and is not disqualified by the limitations listed in Article 3, Section 1 of the national bylaws may join as a provisional member by paying dues to the Socialist Rifle Association. Provisional members shall have access to National SRA resources such as the Forum, but will not have access to Chapter resources, Chapter general meetings, or Chapter in-person events until becoming full members.

Individuals falling within the geographic boundaries of the Chapter who do not wish to join the National level Organization may elect to become a **Local Comrade** of the Chapter. After providing a donation to the Chapter they become a provisional local comrade of the chapter. Provisional local comrades will not have access to Chapter resources, Chapter general meetings, or Chapter in-person events until becoming full local comrades. Except as otherwise explicitly stated, all provisions of the Chapter bylways pertaining to Chapter members also pertain to Chapter local comrades, including but not limited to: all membership disqualifications that apply to members also apply to local comrades.

To become a full member or full local comrade of the Organization and the Chapter, a provisional member or provisional local comrade shall undergo a vetting process. A provisional member or provisional local comrade shall be contacted by the Secretary and provided with the ability to attend a vetting interview, either in-person or virtual call with video for the provisional member or provisional local comrade. The Chapter Vetting Chair will assign three or more members of the Vetting Committee to attend the interview. The Secretary or Vetting Chair may serve on the Vetting Committee. This interview shall consist, at minimum, questions regarding the provisional member or provisional local comrade's reasons for joining the SRA, what brought them to a leftist understanding, their goals for their participation in the SRA, what they would like to see the SRA doing, their previous involvement in leftist organizing, mutual aid and/or direct action, and their involvement in communities that the Socialist Rifle Association has a vested interest in getting involved with; i.e. those stated in Article Two, Section One. The Vetting Committee will maintain an up-to-date Standard Operating Procedure with questions to ask the new provisional member or provisional local comrade. Other full members or full local comrades of the Chapter may, at times, suggest new questions.

If both the Committee members agree that no suspicious or otherwise questionable responses were given, the provisional member or provisional local comrade will gain access to Chapter educational resources, Chapter general meetings, and Chapter in-person events. After vetting, provisional members and provisional local comrades become full members and full local comrades, respectively, of the Chapter. Members (not local comrades) shall be nominated for ascension with the national Organization, vouched for by the Secretary and the Vetting Chair.

The CCC may elect to gate some non-educational Chapter resources and discussion fora behind attending an in-person educational event, requirements for which are at the CCC and firearms workstream leads' discretion. At the CCC and firearms training workstream leads' discretion, the CCC may choose an expiration period after a member's last in-person class attendance at which time the member loses access to these non-educational resources.

The Chapter may enact further clarifying policies on the exploratory interview process by majority vote of the membership, as proposed by the Vetting Chair and Vetting Committee.

A member or local comrade may lose their role in the Chapter by resigning or by expulsion from the group. Expulsion (temporary or permanent) can take place as part of a disciplinary procedure decided upon by the Chapter MWC with majority approval from CCC after a discussion period of no less than 48 hours with chapter leadership; or expulsion may be enacted by the Secretary and/or Treasurer for administrative reasons such as dues arrears or removal from National roster.

If a national member is expelled from the chapter, the Liaison shall recommend the member's expulsion from the Organization to the National Welfare Council, requiring a second from the Secretary.
