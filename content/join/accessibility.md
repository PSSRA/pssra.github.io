PSSRA is committed to making our firearms education accessible to all members.

We know that training sometimes involves barriers, whether physical, financial, or logistical, and we work with members to reduce or remove them.

## Our Commitments
- **Accessibility is standard.** We treat accommodations as a normal part of membership, not an exception.
- **Multiple paths to participation.** If a class format doesn't work for you, we will explore alternatives.
- **Privacy and respect.** Information you share about accessibility is kept confidential and only used to coordinate your participation.
- **Ongoing conversation.** Needs can change over time. You can raise accessibility issues at any point.

## Examples of Accommodations
Here are some ways we may be able to adjust training:
- Alternative training locations or online modules
- Modified or paced physical activities
- Working around equipment and consumable-supply costs/needs
- One-on-one coaching when group sessions are a barrier

This list is not exhaustive; tell us what you need, and we'll work with you.

## How to Request Support
You can let us know about accessibility needs:
- Prior to your vetting session
- In follow-up conversations with the onboarding team  
- At any time by contacting **accessibility@pugetsoundsra.org** or by creating a support ticket in Discord.

## Bottom line
You don't need to figure out accommodations alone. We want every member to benefit fully from what PSSRA offers.
