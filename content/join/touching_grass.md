Our chapter's foremost goal with new members is to immediately provide an opportunity to "touch grass" and make it out to an in-person introductory class as soon as as they make it into the org. To that end, new members' experience in the chapter is heavily directed towards that goal, meeting other members in person, taking a class, and getting some live-fire experience with us.

Joining the chapter just to participate online doesn't align with our mission of providing accessible, inclusive, and high-quality firearms education.

For this reason, some of the chapter resources (Discord channels) are gated behind "touching grass" and making it out to a live-fire class like our introductory "Pistol 1" class, designed to be accessible to everyone, with or without firearms experience, with or without owning their own firearm.

(We also have some pre-range day classes, with no live fire, designed to help get members who are extremely new to firearms comfortable with them in a no-ammo-allowed setting. These classes are designed to make it easier/more comfortable to get out to a range day and do not count for "touching grass".)

Once you meet your comrades in person at a range day, we grant the "Toucher of Grass" role in Discord, opening up channels related to memes, general chat, and more free-wheeling gun and gear chat.
