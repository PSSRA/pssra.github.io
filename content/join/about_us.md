The Puget Sound chapter of the SRA is an organization operating across Washington State focused on firearms education among comrades. We have some excellent instructors who run highly-inclusive classes for our members at many different levels of firearms familiarity, in several locations all over Washington.

We also have more free-form range days, as well as occasional social events and an active [Discord](discord) for vetted members. Finally, we also have members who regularly attend competitions to test their training against difficult shooting challenges, and help other interested members get into competitive shooting.

What we DON'T do as an org is organize any kind of direct action, protesting as a group, or ever show up to events armed. We also don't generally do mutual aid or community outreach that isn't firearms education related. We don't have prohibitions on our members doing those things (joining the Discord after vetting is a great way to meet comrades in your area, and we try to help connect members with other orgs who do focus on mutual aid), but the organization does not take part. (We say this up front because some people come to us looking for that kind of activity.)
