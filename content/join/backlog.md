While we are working through an intake backlog due to current events --- an unprecedented number of emails since Nov 2024 and continuing through Feb 2025 --- we are instituting a queue for bringing new folks into the intake/vetting process so that you're not waiting around for vetting forever.

**If this article is still visible, the queue is still in effect.**

PSSRA's intake and vetting has traditionally been "as fast as we can get people in"-- as soon as we get emails or other inquiries, we'd get folks signed up and in the pipeline for vetting (i.e., into our vetting-specific [Discord](discord) server). Normal pace until November 2024 was, at most, 1-2 signups per week with one vetting session per month.

November 2024, for obvious reasons, resulted in an explosion of interest. For the whole month of November we set a pace of recruitment and intake that was unsustainable and left many prospective members waiting around for vetting for a long time, and even once vetted, were (and continue to be) left waiting for openings in an intro class that meets their skillset and needs.

PSSRA's foremost goal with new members is to immediately provide an opportunity to ["touch grass"](touching_grass) and make it out to an in-person introductory class as soon as as they make it into the org. Ramping up vetting pace is both tough on our vetting committee, and leads to overloaded onboarding opportunities.

Current ({{< currentdate >}}) wait time between initial contact and being ready to get folks into vetting is up to one month.

We appreciate your patience, and we will get everyone into the intake/vetting process as soon as possible!
