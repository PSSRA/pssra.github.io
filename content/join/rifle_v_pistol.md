"As the Socialist Rifle Association, do you only offer training on rifles?"

No! In fact, while we do offer occasional practical rifle training classes at a few different experience levels, we primarily focus on practical pistol training for several reasons.

The Washington Assault Weapons Ban that became effective in April 2023 made it impossible to buy our only previously-recommended semiautomatic rifle platform, the AR-15. Individuals who owned those rifles prior to the ban are allowed to keep and train with them, but given our focus on training new shooters, we are de-emphasizing practical rifle use.

Handguns are far more likely to be used in realistic defensive scenarios, and most of the training we provide for practical pistol use is directly applicable to practical rifle. (The reverse is less true.) In other words, a person who wants to improve their skills with a semiautomatic rifle is well-served by improving their pistol skills (and given the ammo cost differential, will save money doing so), whether they already own a rifle, or should the laws change in the future.

We welcome new shooters who do not yet own a handgun to our intro pistol courses, where they will be able to participate fully. We are not able to do the same for new shooters who do not own a rifle for our practical rifle courses.

"What about [insert Washington-compliant rifle]?"

None of the currently-offered rifles in Washington (like the Ruger Mini-14) meet our standards for a practical weapon in the same way as the AR-15. We suggest investing in practical pistol (time, effort, equipment, ammo) instead of spending money on these options.

"What about bolt action or hunting rifles?"

We have some classes related to long-range precision shooting, and those mostly take place in our "East" region; ranges and pits with sufficient distance are hard to come by west of the Cascades. Our chapter includes Subject Matter Experts who are happy to provide guidance on long-range precision shooting equipment, skills, and competitions.

"What about shotguns?"

We do not offer training on defensive shotgun use.
