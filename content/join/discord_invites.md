After you make it through the backlog and join as a local comrade or national member, we will invite you to a Vetting Discord server. If you are clicking the invite link on a computer, and **if you have an existing Discord account that you'd like to use**, you will need to log in to Discord on your browser before accepting the invitation.

If you see this, ðŸ›‘ **STOP** ðŸ›‘:

{{< figure
  src="/img/discord_invite_no_login.png"
  alt="Discord invite, not logged in"
  class="ma0"
>}}

If you click the invite link and are greeted with a dialog box that looks like the above, **you are not logged in to an existing account**; entering a display name in the text field and clicking "Continue" **will create a new Discord account**.

Instead, if you have a Discord account that you'd like to use to join the vetting server, click **"Already have an account?"** at the bottom and log in.

Even better, you can log into Discord in the browser here and then click the invite link. You can also accept the invite on a mobile device if you have the Discord app installed and logged in, which should automatically open it in the app.

If you see this when you click the invite link, then you're already logged in, and should be good to go:

{{< figure
  src="/img/discord_invite_logged_in.png"
  alt="Discord invite, logged in"
  class="ma0"
>}}

Please ping the intake/vetting team with any questions. If you accidentally join with the wrong account (i.e., if you don't see your other Discord servers alongside the vetting server), we can switch your status to the correct account, just let us know.
