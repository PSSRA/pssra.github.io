We are a leftist, community-focused firearms education organization. These rules exist to minimize legal risk, uphold Discord's Terms of Service (to prevent possible shutdown), and maintain a safe, respectful environment for members. Our risk increases the more we diverge from focusing on our goal of providing high quality, respectful firearms training, and we appreciate your help in minimizing that risk.

## 1. üö® High Priority Rules (Immediate Risk to Org or Platform)
### 1.1. Illegal or Prohibited Content
- Do **not** post or encourage any content that is illegal under:
  - U.S. federal law
  - Washington State law
  - Discord's Terms of Service
- This includes, but is not limited to:
  - Confessing to, detailing, or soliciting illegal acts
    - e.g., manufacturing firearms, import or sale of high-capacity magazines or assault weapons in WA, drug use (including cannabis)
  - Promoting criminal activity
  - Buying/selling/trading firearms or parts (Discord ToS)
    - ‚ùó Exceptions: Accessories like holsters, slings, optics are allowed.
- Oblique or veiled references to illegal activity ("in Minecraft" e.g.) will not be tolerated.

### 1.2. Violence and Threats
- Do not make **direct threats of violence** toward **any specific, identifiable, living individuals**.
- Do not post threats toward specific **organizations or bodies** (e.g., the DNC).
- Expressions of systemic critique are permitted (e.g., landlords, slaveowners), but must not cross into incitement.
- Veiled references to violence will not be tolerated.

### 1.3. Avoid Time-Sensitive or "Direct Action" or News Content
As a government recognized 501c4 non-profit organization providing firearms training for leftists, we will greatly increase our risk if we end up being perceived as associated with direct action. We additionally try very hard to strictly focus on information directly related to our mission to allow our members to control their news and alert intake. Therefore, do **not** post:
- Live or time-sensitive reports about enforcement actions or government activity.
  - Could be construed as a call to action, reporting on these specifics is not in scope for our goals as an organization, and creates risk of us being associated with direct action
- Current events **not directly related to firearms training or equipment**, i.e., almost all news posts.
  - We believe in "opting in" to receive news, and it is usually not relevant to our goals of providing high quality firearms training

### 1.4. Operational Security (OpSec)
- Assume all communications are compromised.
- Practice good digital security hygiene: https://ssd.eff.org
  - Vetted members can also review [Message Discipline](https://wiki.pugetsoundsra.org/en/messageDiscipline) and [Basics of Security](https://wiki.pugetsoundsra.org/security) on the internal wiki.
- Do not publish, comment, message, or post personally identifiable information about other users.
- We also strongly discourage posting any personally identifiable information about yourself.

## 2. üîí Community Safety & Mental Health
### 2.1. Harassment and Abuse
- No harassment, bullying, insults, or targeted attacks ‚Äî public or private.
- "Ironic" bigotry is still bigotry.
- If you feel unsafe, contact a moderator or the Membership Welfare Committee (MWC) immediately. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact a moderator or member of leadership immediately.
- If someone within leadership has made you feel this way, please reach out to an admin or the Membership Welfare Committee (MWC). We care about making this community a safe place.

### 2.2. Mental Health Crises
- This is **not** a mental health service.
- Posts about active mental health crises will be removed. Our leadership team is not equipped to provide mental healthcare, and others can be harmed/triggered.
- If you need help:
  - Dial 988 for mental health emergencies
  - Use external support resources: [Resource Directory](https://www.hca.wa.gov/free-or-low-cost-health-care/i-need-behavioral-health-support/mental-health-crisis-lines#crisis-lines)

### 2.3. No Explicit or NSFW Content
- This server is **safe-for-work**.
- No nudity or sexually explicit material.
- Offending content will be removed and followed up with the poster.
- Repeat violations will result in loss of ["Toucher of Grass" role](https://www.pugetsoundsra.org/join/touching_grass/) (i.e. access to social channels), posting privileges, or membership.
