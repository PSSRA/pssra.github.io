If you'd like, you can go ahead and join our parent organization at https://socialistra.org, but please know that *we will not be able to provide you vetting into the local chapter* for some time; you will still be part of the same queue. If you do join national, please reply back with your membership number so I can keep an eye out for you on our local roster.

If you'd prefer to wait, there are other options for local-only membership. We will tell you about those options when you're off the [backlog](backlog) and we're ready to start your intake.
