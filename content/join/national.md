If you'd like, you can go ahead and join our parent organization at [socialistra.org/membership](https://socialistra.org/membership), but please know that *we will not be able to provide you vetting into the local chapter* for some time; you will still be part of the same queue.

If you do join national, please reply back on your email or forum thread (however you've been in touch with us) with your membership number so we can keep an eye out for you on our local roster.

If you'd prefer to wait, there are other options for local-only membership. We will tell you about those options when you're off the [backlog](backlog) and we're ready to start your intake.
