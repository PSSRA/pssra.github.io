PSSRA has two options for joining us. You can either [join and become a member of National SRA](https://app.joinit.com/o/socialist-rifle-association), or you can join as a chapter-only "Local Comrade". Both allow vetted individuals to join our range days and participate in our Discord, but there are some important differences.

We recommend making this decision based primarily on your comfort being on National SRA's roster.
