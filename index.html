        <h3>Who are we?</h3>
        <p>The Puget Sound Socialist Rifle Association (PSSRA) is a chapter of the Socialist Rifle Association (SRA), a 501(c)(4) non-profit dedicated to responsible gun use and community self-defense. We are based in the Puget Sound area of the state of Washington.</p>

        <h3>What do we do?</h3>
        <p>We are a firearms education organization, focused on ensuring our members are learning and practicing safe firearms protocols.

We are not a militia and do not function as such. We do not utilize a paramilitary command structure or provide training specific to paramilitary applications.

We have monthly membership meetings and range days around the Puget Sound area.</p>

        <h3>What can we do for you?</h3>
        <p>We can be (and are!) a friendly resource for those who wish to learn and improve their firearms skills, improve their accuracy, and learn other related skills such as first aid.</p>

        <h3>What about "socialist"?</h3>
        <p>We are a big tent organization representing a variety of leftist ideologies. We have no requirements that you be a socialist, but we do expect that all our members maintain a respectful manner towards leftists different than themselves.</p>

        <h1>Interested?</h1>
        <p>We have a few prohibitions on membership:</p>
        <p>We do not tolerate abusers, supporters of fascism/racism or other reactionary movements, or supporters of exclusionary social ideologies such as ableism or homophobia. We do not allow members to be active law enforcement officers or employed at domestic intelligence agencies. This is not a comprehensive list, but should give you a sense of what we're about.
